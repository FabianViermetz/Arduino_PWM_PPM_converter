# Arduino_PWM_PPM_converter

The Goal of this Project is to build a PWM to PPM Converter with an Arduino Pro Mini or similar Boards.

This helps to reduce wiring in RC-Models and helps to increase the range of Functions for controllers like Naze, Multiwii and so on.


i managed to push the limits of an ATMega328 and added 18CH PWM input and output which makes it perfect for a Hexapod servo controller and many other projects that require more PWM than usual recievers/converters can give.

Please remind that this is still work in progress and not perfect and that you are using this on your own risk.
